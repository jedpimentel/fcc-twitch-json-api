Created as part of the freecodecamp.com curriculum.
Problem statement: http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api

This is basically a curated list of twitch channels, which pulls avatars and current channel status from the twitch API.

The Twitch channel list is saved inside the script.js file.

This is meant to be responsive or embedded inside a frame
